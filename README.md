# Image_Blending_with_Contours
A fun project involving experimentation with the contours module present in OpenCV.

The following code identifies the contours (using edge detection from the OpenCV module) from two separate images and then cycles through each contour to redraw the inner pixels on a new image. This works very well on two aligned images to blend a face, such as two dog faces.
